# SAFE -- THE APP THAT REVOLUTIONIZES SECURITY AND INFORMATION STORAGE

<br>

## What SAFE is all about
In this day and age, the use of electronics have increased significantly. When it comes to banking, storing personal information and more….EVERYTHING IS ON OUR CELLPHONES NOW! The protection of personal information is something often overlooked but is very important to address now more than ever with information breaches and cyber-security compromises. We came up with the idea to build an app called SAFE which is a password-protected cellphone app that stores all personal information in a cellular device acting as a safe for all personal information. Users can choose to share info if they want with other users from the app and all of the shared data is safely encrypted.

Once the user signs up using the app, they will be greeted by a user-friendly home-screen which will initially contain customizable folders that can be set up for private information storage. 

The cool thing about SAFE is that users are able to share private and personal information with other authorized users directly from the app itself.

## End-to-end encryption (E2EE)
E2EE was one of the things that we focused a lot on for the development of SAFE. E2EE ensures that the data shared from one authorized user to another through SAFE remains confidential to the users involved in the sharing session.

<br>

### Why E2EE:
* In order to protect the clients’ credential data during a sharing session
* SAFE’s implementation structure is meant to reassure users of its security using E2EEE 
* SAFE is targeted to become an essential tool for sharing credentials
* E2EE provides absolute security for all clients using the share feature

<br>

### How SAFE uses E2EEE:
* Outgoing and incoming credential data using the share feature must be encrypted/decrypted
* SAFE’s server will only handle encrypted data received from the client
* The Diffie-Hellmen algorithm will be used to ensure powerful security
* When sharing data, E2EE will be enabled by default

## How we built the app
The ideas were listed in the slides along with a very basic implementation of the app. The design interface concept was made as an example using Figma. Finally, Flutter was used to visually display the app.

## Challenges that we ran into
Our team encountered some challenges with the development and coming up with an idea for an app. We decided to think about ongoing problems in the world that are connected to technology and have a huge impact on us. After recognizing the problem, we decided to come up with a solution for that problem and implement the solution into our app. 

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
We are proud of working together as a team and coming up with a potential solution that could revolutionize the world one day. Everything is on our cellphones now, from banking information to electronic gift cards. Creating a reliable and safe storage solution in this day and age is something we are definitely proud of.

## What we learned 
Throughout this project, we learned to work collaboratively with each other and efficiently maintain a smooth workflow to complete this project. Furthermore, while working as a team, we also learned to implement each of our ideas and modify the idea according to each of our views and perspectives.

<br>

## Whats next for SAFE
We hope this project will be considered as a possible solution for safe personal data storage in this day and age. We think an idea like SAFE will go a long way and potentially become a primary solution for users that expect security/storage solutions for senstive data in one single app.
